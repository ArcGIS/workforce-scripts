    "\n",
    "One common app used in integration with Workforce is Survey123. Dispatchers may want to take captured survey data to then drive new assignments - allowing the field worker to have control over what assignments are made. Say a field worker sees a sidewalk repair that needs to be completed, but doesn't have time to accomplish it or the dispatcher access to create an assignment. We can instead have them collect to a survey and then run our Jupyter Notebook to convert those surveys to assignments. "
